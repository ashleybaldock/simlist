Simlist - Simutrans listing server

server.js is designed to be run via Node, version 10.12 or greater. Logging goes to stdout/stderr.

Persistent data is saved to a MongoDB database.

Configuration is via environment parameters:

HEADER_IMAGE   - the header image/logo to use for the top of the page (default: "simlogo.png")
PORT           - the TCP port to bind to (default: "80")
MONGOLAB_URI   - the (MongoLabs) or otherwise MongoDB connection string (no default)
PRUNE_INTERVAL - the time (in seconds) after which old server listings are removed (default: 604800)


Installation

Check out source, run "npm install" to install required packages. Set desired environment parameters and then run using "node server.js".

Current version is optimised to run on Heroku.


Instances

The server can be run with multiple instances, if you need multiple listings servers. Note that this requires compiled-in support from the game itself and is only really useful to let you run listings servers for both the standard and experimental versions of the game.
